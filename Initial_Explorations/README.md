# ⚛️ Initial explorations – data processing and qutrit simulation tests ✨✈️

This directory contains a collection of early exploratory Jupyter notebooks created during the initial phase of the project.  
They include experiments on two main fronts:

1. **Data processing tests** 🍄 
   Early attempts at handling and preprocessing datasets (e.g., CMS data, paper-related data, alternative preprocessing approaches).

2. **Quantum simulation explorations**  🚀
   Preliminary investigations into the feasibility of working with **qutrit-based simulations**, including tests using different libraries and frameworks (Cirq, QuForge, custom implementations, etc.).  
   These notebooks were used to understand what current tooling offered, evaluate simulator limitations, and compare qutrit vs. qubit approaches for tasks such as generative models and autoencoders.

Although these notebooks were useful during the exploratory phase, **they are no longer directly related to the current direction of the project**. They are kept here for reference, historical context, and potential future insights.
